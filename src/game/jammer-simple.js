// DEPRECATED FILE - Use broadcast-jammer.js instead
// This file has been replaced by the clean broadcast-jammer.js implementation
// to resolve conflicts between multiple jammer systems.
//
// The game now uses:
// - src/game/broadcast-jammer.js (main jammer system)
// - src/engine/jammer-indicator.js (off-screen arrows)
// - src/game/sector1-progression.js (spawning control)
//
// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but should be removed from index.html

console.log('⚠️ jammer-simple.js has been deprecated - use broadcast-jammer.js');
