// DEPRECATED FILE - Use jammer-indicator.js instead
// This file has been replaced by the cleaner jammer-indicator.js implementation
// to resolve conflicts between multiple arrow indicator systems.
//
// The game now uses:
// - src/engine/jammer-indicator.js (unified arrow indicator system)
// - src/game/broadcast-jammer.js (main jammer system)
//
// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but should be removed from index.html

console.log('⚠️ jammer-arrows.js has been deprecated - use jammer-indicator.js');
