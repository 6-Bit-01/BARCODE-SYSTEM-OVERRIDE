// DEPRECATED FILE - Use broadcast-jammer.js instead
// This file has been removed because it was causing orange square visual artifacts.
// The game now uses only the BroadcastJammerSystem which is cleaner and more reliable.
//
// The game now uses:
// - src/game/broadcast-jammer.js (main jammer system)
// - src/engine/jammer-indicator.js (off-screen arrows)
// - src/game/sector1-progression.js (spawning control)
//
// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but should be removed from index.html

console.log('📡 simple-jammer.js has been deprecated - use broadcast-jammer.js');
