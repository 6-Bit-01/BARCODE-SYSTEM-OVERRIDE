# Acceptance and Test Status

## Current Jammer transition retest — September 11, 2026

Review branch: `agent/jammer-rhythm-exit`, based on merged PR #29. Owner verification pending; preceding playtest results remain historical.

1. Finish the Jammer with R + correctly timed Down. Rhythm UI/stance must exit immediately on hit sixteen.
2. Press R repeatedly through freeze, purge, pan, entrance, close-up, flourish, hold and camera return. It must not reactivate; movement remains frozen for the cinematic.
3. At control handoff, move normally. Down must require R again. Press R, then verify normal boss rhythm counters.
4. Listen for continuous music/beat timing across the transition. No restart, duplicated music or held final-attack pose.

Production-module assertions cover these lifecycle properties and transport continuity. Makko confirmation remains necessary. New overhaul/effect ideas are proposals and require a separately scoped implementation pass.

## Current test target — musical combat pass

Use `agent/level1-musical-combat` at the revision in the generated manifest. PR #28 is merged. The owner's latest run was substantially better and reached victory, but the difficult boss was defeated through an endless head-bounce exploit. Current acceptance is **pending for the new branch**, and the older test sections below remain historical evidence.

1. Play the usual Level 1 route once. Check the opening boundary, H/R tutorial locks, opposite-direction cancellation, lethal ordinary stomps, lift and safe Jammer placement. The quota remains twenty; Jammer health remains sixteen.
2. Read enemy warnings: jump a Corrupted charge, dodge the marked swooper lane, and counter after a Firewall braces/sweeps. Report if labels obscure bodies or any committed attack unexpectedly turns toward you.
3. Use R + Down: the nearby markers should meet on the beat. Miss early and late deliberately; check the feedback. Take a hit and check that R re-entry is obvious and the song continues.
4. Fight the boss with rhythm counters. The first warning/opening should be forgiving. Six health adds a second pulse; only the last three health can speed up the pattern after the introductory cycles. Hold a normal jump to clear the double pulse. Is the window long enough to recognize it and land useful attacks?
5. Try the previous exploit with no horizontal input. A head landing should send you safely outward. Repeated hovering must not damage another cycle; landing rearms an intentional next stomp. Judge the 260 ms rebound impulse and try both sides/near an arena edge.
6. Lose/retry directly, pause/resume, win/rematch and restart the full level. No stale rebound, beat warning, damage message or duplicate music should survive.

Use the existing Go / Reset Boss development control after the normal run to avoid repeating the entire level. Report how many attempts a legitimate win took, which attack caused most damage, and anything that feels unfair. Automated tests passing do not replace this feel/audio/rendering check.

## Historical acceptance records

## Status

PR #27 is merged at `a69384e5c647e0f1f457564ccbb3c29cd37e2059`. The owner's first playtest reported: unrestricted tutorial movement past the later gate; boss size/alignment changing with animation; boss carried by camera return; immediate death after attempting a stomp; Jammer/lift interaction overlap. **This is a failed acceptance pass, not approval of those behaviors.**

The current `agent/level1-playtest-repairs` branch addresses these reports and awaits a new owner Makko pass. No current Makko/browser gameplay acceptance is claimed. `SOURCE_MANIFEST.json` and `test-evidence.json` identify the exact code, review status and automated receipt.

## Focused repair retest

1. Hold right during the opening tutorial; also try crossing the opening boundary in the air. Finish the tutorial and check that you start on the correct side with the first encounter reachable.
2. Finish the mission once. Check that the Jammer and its attack area are well clear of the lift, and the lift explains its two on-beat charges before activation.
3. Watch boss walk/idle/flourish transitions: feet should stay on the street and body scale remain consistent. During camera return it should stay by the building where it stopped, then walk toward you after control returns, even from offscreen.
4. At full health, land on the boss during guarded and cyan phases. Both should bounce; only cyan should lose one boss health. Repeat at low health using retry as needed. Report player health before/after any unexpected death and whether a pulse was present.
5. Deliberately lose/retry, win/rematch, then restart the level. Confirm that the opening boundary, mission and music reset correctly.

Use the existing **Go / Reset Boss** development control for repeated boss checks after one normal route. No repeated full mission grind is needed for every animation check.

## Added general-play checks

During the same normal run, check ordinary enemy contact and stomps against their visible bodies; note whether attack messages make timing versus range clear. Follow the encounter-specific progress/hints and watch the Jammer change stage at 12, 8 and 4 health remaining. Completed objectives should leave the active objective visible. Judge the overall flow and readability as well as the original five repair items.

## Required checks

| Check | Expected result | Evidence owner |
|---|---|---|
| Existing suite/all JS syntax | Existing production/runtime checks and Makko parsing coverage pass | Codex receipt |
| Boss logic | Damage only in intended states, counter/stomp opportunity, clean death/retry, one completion, no stale hazards after pause/reset | Codex focused harness |
| Import/title/prologue | Exact supplied revision opens and preserves approved presentation | Owner Makko |
| Tutorial/movement | Space exclusive; H/R locks; background timing; opposing keys cancel; single jump | Owner Makko |
| Contact/lift | Normal enemy damage, lethal ordinary-enemy stomp, two-hit lift and readable foot/roof contact | Owner Makko |
| Normal mission route | 20 post-tutorial defeats; opposite-half Jammer; sixteen rhythm hits; established boss entrance | Owner Makko |
| Boss playthrough | Clear warnings/recovery, a fair loss and retry, successful win and honest end-screen actions | Owner Makko |
| Audio/lifecycle | Pause/resume/retry/full restart without duplicate audio, silent layers, stale attacks or broken reset | Owner Makko |

Use `repository-snapshot/docs/technical/MAKKO_HANDOFF.md` for the step-by-step route. Debug hooks may accelerate repeated testing; one normal-route run remains necessary to validate the full sequence.

## Completion report

Record: tested SHA; PASS/FAIL/PASS WITH NOTES; device/Makko project; exact route and failures; any accepted notes; automated commands/results; asset changes; and merge state. Only then mark M1 accepted and merge it. After merge, rebuild the ZIP at the actual merged SHA and retain the receipt's tested SHA so any difference remains visible.

No regression check may remove an approved mechanic just to satisfy obsolete prose from v4. Conversely, a passing logic harness is not permission to skip the owner/Makko gate.
