# Acceptance and Test Status

## Status

At v5 creation the boss milestone is **unmerged and awaiting owner Makko testing**. No Makko/browser gameplay pass is claimed. `SOURCE_MANIFEST.json` identifies the exported code and status. Included automated evidence is authoritative only for the exact revision it names; a missing or older receipt is not a pass.

The preceding audit reported baseline PR #25 passing `npm test` and `npm run check:syntax:all`. Run and record both again against this milestone. Use the focused boss harness for deterministic attack timing, damage, death, retry, completion and pause/reset edge cases. VM host stubs do not render sprite frames or verify audio.

## Required checks

| Check | Expected result | Evidence owner |
|---|---|---|
| Existing suite/all JS syntax | Existing production/runtime checks and Makko parsing coverage pass | Codex receipt |
| Boss logic | Damage only in intended states, counter/stomp opportunity, clean death/retry, one completion, no stale hazards after pause/reset | Codex focused harness |
| Import/title/prologue | Exact supplied revision opens and preserves approved presentation | Owner Makko |
| Tutorial/movement | Space exclusive; H/R locks; background timing; opposing keys cancel; single jump | Owner Makko |
| Contact/lift | Normal enemy damage, lethal ordinary-enemy stomp, two-hit lift and readable foot/roof contact | Owner Makko |
| Normal mission route | 20 post-tutorial defeats; opposite-half Jammer; sixteen rhythm hits; established boss entrance | Owner Makko |
| Boss playthrough | Clear warnings/recovery, a fair loss and retry, successful win and honest end-screen actions | Owner Makko |
| Audio/lifecycle | Pause/resume/retry/full restart without duplicate audio, silent layers, stale attacks or broken reset | Owner Makko |

Use `repository-snapshot/docs/technical/MAKKO_HANDOFF.md` for the step-by-step route. Debug hooks may accelerate repeated testing; one normal-route run remains necessary to validate the full sequence.

## Completion report

Record: tested SHA; PASS/FAIL/PASS WITH NOTES; device/Makko project; exact route and failures; any accepted notes; automated commands/results; asset changes; and merge state. Only then mark M1 accepted and merge it. After merge, rebuild the ZIP at the actual merged SHA and retain the receipt's tested SHA so any difference remains visible.

No regression check may remove an approved mechanic just to satisfy obsolete prose from v4. Conversely, a passing logic harness is not permission to skip the owner/Makko gate.
